# Approximate Ternary Matrix Multiplication for Image Processing and Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Approximate Ternary Matrix Multiplication** for **image processing** and **ternary neural networks (TNNs)**. The work introduces a **Carbon Nanotube FET (CNTFET)-based ternary systolic array architecture** utilizing **approximate 4:2 compressors** to enhance energy efficiency while maintaining computational accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Ternary 4:2 Compressors**: Reduces hardware complexity by **18%** compared to existing designs.
- **Approximate Multiplication**: Saves **20% energy** over recent approximate ternary multipliers.
- **Systolic Array-Based Matrix Multiplication**: Efficient implementation for **image multiplication and image smoothing**.
- **Ternary Neural Network (TNN) Deployment**: Achieves **90% accuracy** in convolutional layers for classification tasks.
